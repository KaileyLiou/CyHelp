# CyHelp

This is a very simple Python chatbot that describes cybersecurity and the CIA Triad (confidentiality, integrity, availability). This was my first time coding a chatbot, and I was able to learn new concepts.

## How to Run on macOS

1. Download the chatbot file from the "Releases" section (assets â†’ main)
2. Open Terminal
3. Run these commands:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
chmod +x main
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine main
./main
